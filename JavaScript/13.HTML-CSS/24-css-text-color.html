        <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="ptext1">
            <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is simply <strong>dummy</strong> text of the
            printing and typesetting industry.
            <em>Lorem
                Ipsum</em> has been the industry's
            standard dummy text ever <b>since the 1500s</b>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled
            it to make
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only <b>five centuries</b>, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <b>1960s</b> with the release of Letraset
            sheets
            containing
            <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <i>Aldus
                PageMaker</i>
            including versions
            of <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="ptext2">
            Contrary to popular belief, <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is not simply
            <i>random text</i>. It has roots in a piece of
            classical <strong>Latin literature from 45 BC</strong>, making it over <b>2000 years old</b>. Richard
            McClintock, a
            Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
            College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a <em>Lorem
                Ipsum</em>
            passage, and
            going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
            <em>Lorem
                Ipsum</em>
            comes from <b>sections 1.10.32</b> and <b>1.10.33</b> of <i>"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"</i> <u>(The
                Extremes
                of Good and Evil) by Cicero</u>,
            written in <b>45 BC</b>. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
            <i>Renaissance</i>. The
            first line of <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>, <i>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."</i>, comes from a line in
            <b>section
                1.10.32.</b>

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
            the readable content of a page when
            looking at
            its layout. The point of using <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
            letters, as opposed
            to using <i>'Content here, content here'</i>, making it look like readable <b>English</b>. Many desktop
            publishing packages and
            web page editors now use <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> as their default model text, and a search for <i>'lorem
                ipsum'</i>
            will uncover many
            web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
            sometimes
            on
            purpose (injected humour and the like).
