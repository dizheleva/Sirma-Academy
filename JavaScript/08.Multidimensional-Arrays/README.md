# Matrices - Exercises

### 1. Compare Matrices

Write a program that receives two integer matrices (2D arrays) and compares them element by element.

Each matrix contain a line with a positive integer number R - the number of rows in the matrix and C - the number of columns - followed by R lines containing the C numbers, separated by spaces (each line will have an equal amount of numbers).

Print &quot;equal&quot; if the matrices match and &quot;not equal&quot; if they don&#39;t match.

Input |Output
---|---
[[1,2,3], [2,1,3]], [[1,2,3], [2,1,3]] |equal
[[1,2,3], [4,5,6]], [[1,3], [4,5]] |not equal

### 2. Matrix Addition

||8 5 3

### 3. Intersection of Two Matrices

Write a program that receives two char matrices (A[ ][ ] and B[ ][ ]) of the same order M * N and prints the third matrix C[ ][ ], which is filled with the intersecting elements of A and B, otherwise set the element to "\*". Receive M and N, then on 2 * M lines N characters - the matrices elements.
The matrix elements may be any ASCII char except "\*".
